* Strange Loop Cat

This repository explores the beautiful connections between category
theory, self-reference, and formal systems. Drawing inspiration from
Douglas Hofstadter's "Gödel, Escher, Bach", it provides interactive
explorations of categorical concepts with a focus on strange loops and
recursive structures.

** Overview

Category theory offers a powerful mathematical framework for studying
abstract structures and their relationships, while also providing
insights into self-reference and strange loops. This project:

- Visualizes categorical concepts through interactive diagrams
- Implements categorical structures in Guile Scheme
- Explores the connections between formal systems, self-reference, and category theory
- Provides hands-on examples to build intuition for abstract concepts

** Quick Start

- Run the project initialization (one-time setup):
  #+begin_src shell
  make init
  #+end_src

- Open any of the interactive notebooks in Emacs with org-mode
  #+begin_src shell
  # Open the basics notebook with Emacs
  emacs examples/basics.org
  #+end_src

** Interactive Notebooks

This repository contains five interactive org-mode notebooks that you
can use to explore category theory concepts:

- [[file:examples/basics.org][Basics of Categories and Morphisms]] - Introduction to the fundamental
  concepts of categories, objects, morphisms, and composition

- [[file:examples/functors.org][Functors and Natural Transformations]] - Structure-preserving maps
  between categories and transformations between functors

- [[file:examples/yoneda.org][The Yoneda Lemma]] - An exploration of one of the most profound and
  fundamental results in category theory

- [[file:examples/monads.org][Monads and Computational Effects]] - Understanding monads as a
  powerful abstraction for managing computational effects

- [[file:examples/strange-loops.org][Strange Loops and Self-Reference]] - Examining self-reference,
  recursion, and tangled hierarchies with connection to Hofstadter's
  work

Each notebook contains executable code blocks that demonstrate the
concepts discussed and can be tangled to generate standalone Scheme
files.

** Available Commands

This project uses Make for most operations. Here are the available commands:

| Command        | Description                                       |
|----------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| ~make init~    | Initialize the project, creating directories and  |
|                | installing dependencies                           |
| ~make mermaid~ | Generate diagrams from Mermaid definitions        |
| ~make tangle~  | Generate Scheme source files from org file blocks |
| ~make test~    | Run tests for the category theory implementation  |
| ~make docs~    | Generate HTML documentation from org files        |
| ~make clean~   | Remove generated files                            |
| ~make all~     | Generate diagrams and documentation               |

** GEB Connection and Self-Reference

This project draws heavily from Douglas Hofstadter's seminal work
"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid" (GEB). The concept of
strange loops—processes that move through hierarchical levels and
eventually return to their starting point—is central to both GEB and
this project.

Some key connections explored in this repository:

- Category theory provides a formal framework for understanding self-reference
- Yoneda lemma as a category-theoretic form of "introspection"
- Fixed point operators and their relation to strange loops
- Tangled hierarchies in category theory
- Recursive structures and their categorical formalization
