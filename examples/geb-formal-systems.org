* Introduction

This file contains implementations of formal systems and concepts from Douglas Hofstadter's
"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid" (GEB). The implementations serve as 
concrete examples of the abstract concepts discussed in the book and provide a computational
perspective on self-reference, strange loops, and formal systems.

* The MIU Formal System

The MIU system from Chapter I is a formal system with strings built from the symbols M, I, and U,
starting with the axiom MI. It has four rules of inference:

1. If you have a string ending with I, you can add U (xI → xIU)
2. If you have a string starting with M, you can double everything after M (Mx → Mxx)
3. If you have III in your string, you can replace it with U (xIIIy → xUy)
4. If you have UU in your string, you can remove it (xUUy → xy)

The question posed by Hofstadter: Can you derive MU from MI using these rules?

* Typographical Number Theory (TNT)

TNT is a formal system for expressing elementary number theory, introduced in GEB to demonstrate
Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem. It includes variables, constants, operators, and logical symbols.

* Self-Reference and Gödel Numbering

Gödel's breakthrough was encoding statements about formal systems within the systems themselves.
This section implements Gödel numbering and demonstrates how a system can talk about itself.

* Hofstadter's Sequences

GEB introduces several self-referential sequences that exhibit fascinating properties:

** The Q-Sequence
** The G-Sequence
** The H-Sequence

[Implementations of these sequences...]

* Dialogues and Meta-Structures

GEB's dialogues between Achilles and the Tortoise illustrate many concepts through conversation.
Here we implement a meta-structure for creating GEB-style dialogues.

* Canons and Transformations

Bach's music demonstrates transformations that create self-reference and strange loops.
This section implements musical transformations mentioned in GEB.

* Exercises

1. Extend the MIU system with a new rule and explore its implications.
2. Create a TNT proof of a simple theorem.
3. Implement one of the paradoxes discussed in GEB (e.g., the Epimenides paradox).
4. Design your own formal system inspired by GEB.
