## 2. Core Concepts and Terminology

### 2.1 Foundational Structures

- **Category**: Collection of objects, morphisms, with composition and identity morphisms
- **Objects**: Entities in a category (e.g., sets, groups, vector spaces)
- **Morphisms/Arrows**: Maps between objects that can be composed (e.g., functions, homomorphisms)
- **Composition**: Operation combining morphisms f: A → B and g: B → C to form g∘f: A → C
- **Identity morphism**: For each object A, a morphism idₐ: A → A that acts as identity for composition

### 2.2 Functors and Natural Transformations

- **Functor**: Map between categories preserving structure (objects → objects, morphisms → morphisms)
- **Covariant functor**: Preserves direction of morphisms
- **Contravariant functor**: Reverses direction of morphisms
- **Endofunctor**: Functor from a category to itself
- **Natural transformation**: A "morphism between functors" preserving commutative diagrams
- **Natural isomorphism**: Natural transformation where all component morphisms are isomorphisms

### 2.3 Advanced Categorical Structures

- **Limit/Colimit**: Universal constructions representing best aggregation/combination points
- **Product/Coproduct**: Special cases of limits/colimits representing pairing/choice
- **Adjunction**: Pair of functors F: C → D and G: D → C with special correspondence between morphisms
- **Monad**: Endofunctor T with natural transformations η (unit) and μ (multiplication) satisfying coherence
- **Comonad**: Dual notion to monad
- **Yoneda Lemma**: Fundamental result connecting objects to their interaction patterns

### 2.4 Fixed Points and Recursion

- **Fixed point**: For a functor F, an object X where F(X) ≅ X
- **Initial algebra**: Minimal fixed point of a functor (μX.F(X))
- **Terminal coalgebra**: Maximal fixed point of a functor (νX.F(X))
- **Y combinator**: Fixed point operator enabling recursion without self-reference
- **Recursive types**: Types defined via fixed points of type constructors

### 2.5 Strange Loops and Self-Reference

- **Strange loop**: Pattern where moving through hierarchical levels returns to the starting point
- **Tangled hierarchy**: System where levels that should be separate interact
- **Self-reference**: System referring to itself
- **Reflective system**: System that can represent/manipulate its own structure
