    A["Achilles: I've been pondering something quite curious.
    When I play a sequence of perfect fifths on the piano - 
    C to G to D to A and so on - I eventually come back to C, 
    but it takes 12 steps to do so."]
    
    B["Tortoise: Indeed! And do you know what happens when 
    you apply a tritone interval repeatedly?"]
    
    C["Achilles: Let's see... C to F#, then F# to... well, 
    back to C! It cycles after just two steps!"]
    
    D["Tortoise: Now imagine looking into a mirror. If you 
    place yourself on the line of symmetry, you become your 
    own reflection - a fixed point of the mirror transformation."]
    
    E["Achilles: Just like C and F# are fixed points of the 
    tritone transposition!"]
    
    F["Tortoise: Precisely! And if you look at reflections in 
    two perpendicular mirrors, the only point that remains fixed 
    is the intersection of the mirrors - the origin of the system."]
    
    G["Achilles: These are all strange loops! The system folds 
    back on itself, creating fixed points where movement appears 
    as stillness."]
    
    H["Tortoise: And that, my friend, is the hidden harmony that 
    connects music, direction, and reflection - all manifestations 
    of the same mathematical structure."]
