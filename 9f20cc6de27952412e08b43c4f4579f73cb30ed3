Context:
--------
This commit adds comprehensive tmux/Emacs session management for interactive Scheme development
in the Strange Loop Cat project. The setup provides a dedicated development environment with
all necessary tools preconfigured for working with Guile 3, Org-mode literate programming,
and category theory implementations.

Technical Considerations:
------------------------
1. Environment Variables:
   - PROJECT_NAME and PROJECT_ROOT provide consistent project identification
   - Variables can be overridden via environment or Make invocation
   - Uses ?= in Makefile for flexibility

2. Emacs Configuration:
   - Minimal dependency approach with automatic package installation
   - Geiser configured specifically for Guile 3 (not Guile 2)
   - Load paths automatically set for src/guile and src/generated
   - Paredit for structured S-expression editing
   - Org-babel for literate programming with Scheme blocks
   - TRAMP for potential remote development scenarios

3. Session Management:
   - Tmux provides persistent sessions that survive disconnections
   - TTY information exposed for potential automation/scripting
   - Session names based on project name to avoid conflicts
   - Clean start with -Q flag plus project config for reproducibility

4. Integration Points:
   - Works with existing project structure (src/guile, src/generated)
   - Respects existing .dir-locals.el if present
   - Compatible with existing Make targets (tangle, test, etc.)

Implementation Notes:
--------------------
- Emacs started with -nw for terminal mode (works over SSH)
- -Q flag ensures clean environment before loading project config
- Company-mode configured for intelligent completion
- Rainbow delimiters for better parenthesis visualization
- Custom keybindings avoid conflicts with standard Emacs bindings

Known Issues/Limitations:
------------------------
- Requires tmux to be installed (not checked in Makefile)
- Emacs packages downloaded on first run (may take time)
- MELPA connectivity required for package installation
- Guile 3 specifically required (not backward compatible with Guile 2)

Future Enhancements:
-------------------
- Could add support for multiple concurrent sessions
- Could integrate with direnv for automatic environment setup
- Could add project templates for new files
- Could integrate with project test runner more deeply

Timing:
-------
Implementation completed: 2025-08-06
Total time: ~10 minutes
Files modified: 3 (.envrc, Makefile, new strange-loop-cat.el)

Testing performed:
- Environment variable sourcing verified
- Makefile targets syntax validated
- Dry run of tmux session creation confirmed
