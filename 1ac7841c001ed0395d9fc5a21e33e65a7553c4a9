Implementation notes:

Thought process:
- Identified module binding conflicts between category theory implementation and Guile core functions
- Systematically renamed functions to avoid conflicts while maintaining semantic meaning
- Used prefix 'category-' to clearly distinguish from core Guile functions
- Updated all org files that reference these functions to maintain consistency
- Fixed mermaid diagram blocks that were causing tangling issues

Debugging/Issues:
- Found warnings about overriding core binding for 'compose' and 'identity' functions
- Discovered tangling process was failing on monads.org due to mermaid block configuration
- Identified redundant notebooks directory containing duplicate content
- Located orphaned .scheme file in examples directory

Cleanup performed:
- Renamed compose -> category-compose and identity -> category-identity in core module
- Updated test-runner to use new function names
- Fixed all org files to use new function names (basics.org, functors.org, yoneda.org)
- Added :tangle no directive to mermaid blocks to prevent tangling conflicts
- Removed redundant notebooks directory (9 duplicate .org files)
- Removed orphaned examples/basics.scheme file
- Retangled all org files to regenerate correct Scheme code

Technical decisions:
- Chose 'category-' prefix to be explicit and avoid future conflicts
- Used replace_all flag for systematic updates across files
- Maintained backward compatibility in the API structure
- Verified all generated files work correctly after changes

Future improvements:
- Consider more sophisticated namespace management
- Add more comprehensive test coverage for generated examples
- Implement better error handling in category theory functions
- Add validation for mermaid block configurations
